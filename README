                                            Hello! We are the Boostrap Bandits and this is our website for the Parkstone Grille.

    We set out to design this website for the newly created restaurant, The Parkstone Grille.
    Our intent was/is to make a casual and aesthetic website that will hopefully be used by The Parkstone Grille as they do not currently have their own.
    To do this we used Bootstrap and learned how to add other forms of Javascript into our website to design the product we hoped to create.
    We first looked at the general design of the actual restaurant to decide on color schemes.
    We also "scoped out the competition", in which I mean we looked at other restaurant's websites to see what has worked in the past and gather design ideas to make informed decisions on how our website should look.
    We thought of our own experiences on restaurant websites and came to the conclusion that finding the menu was the main point of our visit the majority of the time. Due to this we made it so that the menu link is presented to you multiple times in the first few seconds of your journey onto the landing page of our website.
    Also, finding the address is another main reason someone might go to a restaurant's website. To solve this we added not only the restaurant's address but also an embeded Google Maps link of the exact restaurant so a customer just has to click the map and they are sent straight to Google Maps where they can plot their route to the restaurant. 
    Each of our members collaborated together to create and design the website you see today!

                                                    Thank you for viewing our website and we hope you enjoy it!
